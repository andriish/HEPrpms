[This package](https://www.davidhbailey.com/dhbsoftware/) provides numeric
types of twice the precision of IEEE double (106 mantissa bits, or
approximately 32 decimal digits) and four times the precision of IEEE double
(212 mantissa bits, or approximately 64 decimal digits).  Due to features such
as operator and function overloading, these facilities can be utilized with
only minor modifications to conventional C++ and Fortran-90 programs.

In addition to the basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply,
divide, square root), common transcendental functions such as the exponential,
logarithm, trigonometric and hyperbolic functions are also included.
